# simple-python-scripts
Simple python scripts that may come up in interviews and such. I'm just having fun with Python, trying to see alternative approaches.

# 1.add-digits-of-number.py
Adding the digits of a number e.g. given 12 return 1+2=3. In this approach, I use Python's inbuilt slicing function.

#2.add-digits-of-number.py
In this approach, I use the / and % functions
